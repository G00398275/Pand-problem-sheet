Note: All references and comments to programs are included in each individual program

The following programs are contained within:

Week 01: Setting up environment and repositories (no file)

Week 02: bmi.py

Week 07: es.py
This program asks the user to input a text file and outputs the number of instances of the letter e in this file.

Week 08: plottask.py
This program isplays a plot of the following functions:
f(x)=x, g(x)=x^2 and h(x)=x^3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes, (and is made to look 'nice' in an attempt to gain extra marks...)
